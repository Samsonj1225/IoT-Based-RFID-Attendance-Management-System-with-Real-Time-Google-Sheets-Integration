# IoT-Based-RFID-Attendance-Management-System-with-Real-Time-Google-Sheets-Integration

This project is a contactless RFID-based attendance system using an ESP32 and MFRC522 RFID reader that records student data directly into a Google Sheet via App Script. It allows you to write student details (Roll Number, Name, Department, Year) onto RFID cards and later scan them to automatically log attendance with a timestamp. Designed for real-time tracking, the system integrates Wi-Fi and Google Sheets for seamless data storage and easy access.
